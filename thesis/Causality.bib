@article{Imbens2010,
abstract = {In Shadish (2010) and West and Thoemmes (2010), the authors contrasted 2 approaches to causality. The first originated in the psychology literature and is associated with work by Campbell (e.g., Shadish, Cook, {\&} Campbell, 2002), and the second has its roots in the statistics literature and is associated with work by Rubin (e.g., Rubin, 2006). In this article, I discuss some of the issues raised by Shadish and by West and Thoemmes. I focus mostly on the impact the 2 approaches have had on research in a 3rd field, economics. In economics, the ideas of both Campbell and Rubin have been very influential, with some of the methods they developed now routinely taught in graduate programs and routinely used in empirical work and other methods receiving much less attention. At the same time, economists have added to the understanding of these methods and through these extensions have further improved researchers' ability to draw causal inferences in observational studies.},

@article{Maldonado1993,
abstract = {In the absence of prior knowledge about population relations, investigators frequently employ a strategy that uses the data to help them decide whether to adjust for a variable. The authors compared the performance of several such strategies for fitting multiplicative Poisson regression models to cohort data: 1) the "change-in-estimate" strategy, in which a variable is controlled if the adjusted and unadjusted estimates differ by some important amount; 2) the "significance-test-of-the-covariate" strategy, in which a variable is controlled if its coefficient is significantly different from zero at some predetermined significance level; 3) the "significance-test-of-the-difference" strategy, which tests the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; 4) the "equivalence-test-of-the-difference" strategy, which significance-tests the equivalence of the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; and 5) a hybrid strategy that takes a weighted average of adjusted and unadjusted estimates. Data were generated from 8,100 population structures at each of several sample sizes. The performance of the different strategies was evaluated by computing bias, mean squared error, and coverage rates of confidence intervals. At least one variation of each strategy that was examined performed acceptably. The change-in-estimate and equivalence-test-of-the-difference strategies performed best when the cut-point for deciding whether crude and adjusted estimates differed by an important amount was set to a low value (10{\%}). The significance test strategies performed best when the alpha level was set to much higher than conventional levels (0.20).},

abstract = {Feature selection is of crucial importance in model building process to eliminate variables that are not informative. Proper feature selection facilitates the model building by reducing noise and the dimensionality of the problem. However, the lack of correspondences between the features selected by two different feature selection methods raises the question of how to evaluate feature selection methods. Generally, for a given data set, feature selection methods are compared based on the prediction performance. Nevertheless, there are feature selection methods that output distinct subsets of features with statistically equivalent prediction performance. Incorporating causation into the diagram of feature selection presents a candidate to clarify such ambiguity. The purpose of this report is to study different feature selection algorithms and their potential application in causal inference. This report first reviews methodologies in designing feature selection algorithms and their implications to causal inference. Then the performance of several widely used feature selection methods are studied on both simulated data and real data. Several modifications for the backward search algorithm by Nilsson et al. (2007) are also studied to see whether they will improve the performance},

Slated to take effect as law across the EU in 2018, it will restrict automated individual decision-making (that is, algorithms that make decisions based on user-level predictors) which "significantly affect" users. The law will also create a "right to explanation," whereby a user can ask for an explanation of an algorithmic decision that was made about them. We argue that while this law will pose large challenges for industry, it highlights opportunities for machine learning researchers to take the lead in designing algorithms and evaluation frameworks which avoid discrimination.},

abstract = {Causality is an important concept throughout the health sciences and is particularly vital for informatics work such as finding adverse drug events or risk factors for disease using electronic health records. While philosophers and scientists working for centuries on formalizing what makes something a cause have not reached a consensus, new methods for inference show that we can make progress in this area in many practical cases. This article reviews core concepts in understanding and identifying causality and then reviews current computational methods for inference and explanation, focusing on inference from large-scale observational data. While the problem is not fully solved, we show that graphical models and Granger causality provide useful frameworks for inference and that a more recent approach based on temporal logic addresses some of the limitations of these methods.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Network inference algorithms are powerful computational tools for identifying putative causal interactions among variables from observational data. Bayesian network inference algorithms hold particular promise in that they can capture linear, non-linear, combinatorial, stochastic and other types of relationships among variables across multiple levels of biological organization. However, challenges remain when applying these algorithms to limited quantities of experimental data collected from biological systems. Here, we use a simulation approach to make advances in our dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference algorithm, especially in the context of limited quantities of biological data.

RESULTS: We test a range of scoring metrics and search heuristics to find an effective algorithm configuration for evaluating our methodological advances. We also identify sampling intervals and levels of data discretization that allow the best recovery of the simulated networks. We develop a novel influence score for DBNs that attempts to estimate both the sign (activation or repression) and relative magnitude of interactions among variables. When faced with limited quantities of observational data, combining our influence score with moderate data interpolation reduces a significant portion of false positive interactions in the recovered networks. Together, our advances allow DBN inference algorithms to be more effective in recovering biological networks from experimentally collected data.

abstract = {Causal inference from observational studies is a fundamental topic in biostatistics. The causal graph literature typically views probability theory as insufficient to express causal concepts in observational studies. In contrast, the view here is that probability theory is a desirable and sufficient basis for many topics in causal inference for the following two reasons. First, probability theory is generally more flexible than causal graphs: Besides explaining such causal graph topics as M-bias (adjusting for a collider) and bias amplification and attenuation (when adjusting for instrumental variable), probability theory is also the foundation of the paired availability design for historical controls, which does not fit into a causal graph framework. Second, probability theory is the basis for insightful graphical displays including the BK-Plot for understanding Simpson's paradox with a binary confounder, the BK2-Plot for understanding bias amplification and attenuation in the presence of an unobserved binary confounder, and the PAD-Plot for understanding the principal stratification component of the paired availability design.

abstract = {Supervised machine learning models boast re-markable predictive capabilities. But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell you about the world? We want models to be not only good, but inter-pretable. And yet the task of interpretation ap-pears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for in-terpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim inter-pretability axiomatically, absent further explana-tion. In this paper, we seek to refine the dis-course on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretabil-ity, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of dif-ferent notions, and question the oft-made asser-tions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

abstract = {Consider a clinical trial where subjects are randomized to two treatment arms but compliance to the assignment is not perfect. Concerning this problem, this paper derives non-parametric bounds on treatment effects by making use of the observed covariates information. The new bounds are narrower and more informative than the existing ones. In addition, a new non-parametric point estimation approach is proposed based on stratified analysis. Furthermore, to examine the accuracy of estimating the proposed bounds, we provide variance estimators for the proposed approach. The results of this paper can yield credible information on treatment effects, which will be useful for medical research and public health policy analysis.},

abstract = {Standard variable selection procedures, primarily developed for the construction of outcome prediction models, are routinely applied when assessing exposure effects in observational studies. We argue that this tradition is sub-optimal and prone to yield bias in exposure effect estimators as well as their corresponding uncertainty estimators. We weigh the pros and cons of confounder-selection procedures and propose a procedure directly targeting the quality of the exposure effect estimator. We further demonstrate that certain strategies for inferring causal effects have the desirable features (a) of producing (approximately) valid confidence intervals, even when the confounder-selection process is ignored, and (b) of being robust against certain forms of misspecification of the association of confounders with both exposure and outcome.},

abstract = {We are interested in learning causal relationships between pairs of random variables, purely from observational data. To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's "Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard.},

More generally, we show that for any hereditary and equivalence-invariant property {\$}\backslashPi{\$} known to hold in {\$}{\{}\backslashcal G{\}}{\$}, we retain the large-sample optimality guarantees of GES even if we ignore any GES deletion operator during the backward phase that results in a state for which {\$}\backslashPi{\$} does not hold in the common-descendants subgraph.},

abstract = {Causation is in trouble –at least as it is pictured in current theories in philosophy and in economics as well, where causation is also once again in fashion. In both disciplines the accounts of causality on offer are either modelled too closely on one or another favoured method for causes or on assumptions about the to which causal knowledge can be put – generally for predicting the results of our efforts to change the world. The first kind of account supplies no reason to think that causal knowledge, as it is pictured, is of any use; the second supplies no reason to think our best methods will be reliable for establishing causal knowledge. So, if these accounts are all there is to be had, how do we get from method to use? Of what use is knowledge of causal laws that we work so hard to obtain?},

abstract = {Ontology evolution aims at maintaining an ontology up to date with respect to changes in the domain that it models or novel requirements of information systems that it enables. The recent industrial adoption of Semantic Web techniques, which rely on ontologies, has led to the increased importance of the ontology evolution research. Typical approaches to ontology evolution are designed as multiple-stage processes combining techniques from a variety of fields (e.g., natural language processing and reasoning). However, the few existing surveys on this topic lack an in-depth analysis of the various stages of the ontology evolution process. This survey extends the literature by adopting a process-centric view of ontology evolution. Accordingly, we first provide an overall process model synthesized from an overview of the existing models in the literature. Then we survey the major approaches to each of the steps in this process and conclude on future challenges for techniques aiming to solve that particular stage.},

abstract = {We argue for a theoretical link between the development of an extended period of immaturity in human evolution and the emergence of powerful and wide-ranging causal learning mechanisms, specifically the use of causal models and Bayesian learning. We suggest that exploratory childhood learning, childhood play in particular, and causal cognition are closely connected. We report an empirical study demonstrating one such connection--a link between pretend play and counterfactual causal reasoning. Preschool children given new information about a causal system made very similar inferences both when they considered counterfactuals about the system and when they engaged in pretend play about it. Counterfactual cognition and causally coherent pretence were also significantly correlated even when age, general cognitive development and executive function were controlled for. These findings link a distinctive human form of childhood play and an equally distinctive human form of causal inference. We speculate that, during human evolution, computations that were initially reserved for solving particularly important ecological problems came to be used much more widely and extensively during the long period of protected immaturity.},

We present an inferential approach that takes any risk-consistent regression adjustment and yields efficient estimates of the average treatment effect. This considerably extends the range of settings where high-dimensional regression adjustments are guaranteed to provide valid inference about the population average treatment effect. We also propose cross-estimation, a simple method for obtaining finite-sample-unbiased treatment effect estimates that leverages high-dimensional regression adjustments. Our method can be used when the regression model is estimated using the lasso, the elastic net, subset selection, or many other methods; we also extend our analysis to allow for adaptive specification search via cross-validation, and flexible non-parametric regression adjustments with, e.g., random forests or neural networks.},

abstract = {Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a crucial problem and has applications in many research areas. PC algorithm is the state-of-the-art method in the constraint based approach. However, the PC algorithm is worst-case exponential to the number of nodes (variables), and thus it is inefficient when applying to high dimensional data, e.g. gene expression datasets where the causal relationships between thousands of nodes (genes) are explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel computing technique. We apply our method on a range of synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from DREAM 5 challenge show that the PC algorithm could not produce any results after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm with a 4-core CPU computer managed to finish within around 12.5 hours, and less than 6 hours with a 8-core CPU computer.},

They propose that children use specialized cognitive systems that allow them to recover an accurate "causal map" of the world: an abstract, coherent, learned representation of the causal relations among events. This kind of knowledge can be perspicuously understood in terms of the formalism of directed graphical causal models, or Bayes nets. Children's causal learning and inference may involve computations similar to those for learning causal Bayes nets and for predicting with them. Experimental results suggest that 2- to 4-year-old children construct new causal maps and that their learning is consistent with the Bayes net formalism.},

@article{Statnikov2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The discovery of molecular pathways is a challenging problem and its solution relies on the identification of causal molecular interactions in genomics data. Causal molecular interactions can be discovered using randomized experiments; however such experiments are often costly, infeasible, or unethical. Fortunately, algorithms that infer causal interactions from observational data have been in development for decades, predominantly in the quantitative sciences, and many of them have recently been applied to genomics data. While these algorithms can infer unoriented causal interactions between involved molecular variables (i.e., without specifying which one is the cause and which one is the effect), causally orienting all inferred molecular interactions was assumed to be an unsolvable problem until recently. In this work, we use transcription factor-target gene regulatory interactions in three different organisms to evaluate a new family of methods that, given observational data for just two causally related variables, can determine which one is the cause and which one is the effect. RESULTS: We have found that a particular family of causal orientation methods (IGCI Gaussian) is often able to accurately infer directionality of causal interactions, and that these methods usually outperform other causal orientation techniques. We also introduced a novel ensemble technique for causal orientation that combines decisions of individual causal orientation methods. The ensemble method was found to be more accurate than any best individual causal orientation method in the tested data. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a first step towards establishing context for practical use of causal orientation methods in the genomics domain. We have found that some causal orientation methodologies yield accurate predictions of causal orientation in genomics data, and we have improved on this capability with a novel ensemble method. Our results suggest that these methods have the potential to facilitate reconstruction of molecular pathways by minimizing the number of required randomized experiments to find causal directionality and by avoiding experiments that are infeasible and/or unethical.},

abstract = {The identification of causal peer effects (also known as social contagion or induction) from observational data in social networks is challenged by two distinct sources of bias: latent homophily and unobserved confounding. In this paper, we investigate how causal peer effects of traits and behaviors can be identified using genes (or other structurally isomorphic variables) as instrumental variables (IV) in a large set of data generating models with homophily and confounding. We use directed acyclic graphs to represent these models and employ multiple IV strategies and report three main identification results. First, using a single fixed gene (or allele) as an IV will generally fail to identify peer effects if the gene affects past values of the treatment. Second, multiple fixed genes/alleles, or, more promisingly, time-varying gene expression, can identify peer effects if we instrument exclusion violations as well as the focal treatment. Third, we show that IV identification of peer effects remains possible even under multiple complications often regarded as lethal for IV identification of intra-individual effects, such as pleiotropy on observables and unobservables, homophily on past phenotype, past and ongoing homophily on genotype, inter-phenotype peer effects, population stratification, gene expression that is endogenous to past phenotype and past gene expression, and others. We apply our identification results to estimating peer effects of body mass index (BMI) among friends and spouses in the Framingham Heart Study. Results suggest a positive causal peer effect of BMI between friends.},

abstract = {The assessment of mediation is important for testing the mechanisms that explain an observed relationship between exposure and disease. Several types of direct and indirect effects have been defined, broadly characterized as either controlled or natural. The identification of these effects requires a stricter set of assumptions than those necessary for the identification of the total effect of exposure on disease. The particular assumptions that are required differ depending on the type of effect. We use an approach based on response types to derive new assumptions for the identification of direct and indirect effects, both controlled and natural. These assumptions are stated in terms of response types and potential outcomes, and are compared with those already in the literature. This approach yields an alternative, and sometimes less stringent, set of assumptions for the identification of direct and indirect effects than those previously proposed.},

@article{Ribeiro2016,
abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We further propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). The usefulness of explanations is shown via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects. Our explanations empower users in various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and detecting why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {Young children spend a large portion of their time pretending about non-real situations. Why? We answer this question by using the framework of Bayesian causal models to argue that pretending and counterfactual reasoning engage the same component cognitive abilities: disengaging with current reality, making inferences about an alternative representation of reality, and keeping this representation separate from reality. In turn, according to causal models accounts, counterfactual reasoning is a crucial tool that children need to plan for the future and learn about the world. Both planning with causal models and learning about them require the ability to create false premises and generate conclusions from these premises. We argue that pretending allows children to practice these important cognitive skills. We also consider the prevalence of unrealistic scenarios in children's play and explain how they can be useful in learning, despite appearances to the contrary.},

abstract = {Automated data-driven decision systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online services, from online social networking and e-commerce to e-government. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead to user discrimination, even in the absence of intent. In this paper, we introduce fairness constraints, a mechanism to ensure fairness in a wide variety of classifiers in a principled manner. Fairness prevents a classifier from outputting predictions correlated with certain sensitive attributes in the data. We then instantiate fairness constraints on three well-known classifiers -- logistic regression, hinge loss and support vector machines (SVM) -- and evaluate their performance in a real-world dataset with meaningful sensitive human attributes. Experiments show that fairness constraints allow for an optimal trade-off between accuracy and fairness.},

abstract = {Node characteristics and behaviors are often correlated with the structure of social networks over time. While evidence of this type of assortative mixing and temporal clustering of behaviors among linked nodes is used to support claims of peer influence and social contagion in networks, homophily may also explain such evidence. Here we develop a dynamic matched sample estimation framework to distinguish influence and homophily effects in dynamic networks, and we apply this framework to a global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users' longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data. We find that previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption decisions in this network by 300-700{\%}, and that homophily explains {\textgreater}50{\%} of the perceived behavioral contagion. These findings and methods are essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive contagions in networks and our knowledge of how to propagate or combat them in domains as diverse as epidemiology, marketing, development economics, and public health.},

Rubin, 1974, 2005) is widely used in economics, statistics, medicine, and public health. Campbell's approach focuses on the identification of threats to validity and the inclusion of design features that may prevent those threats from occurring or render them implausible. Rubin's approach focuses on the precise specification of both the possible outcomes for each participant and assumptions that are mathematically sufficient to estimate the causal effect. In this article, the authors compare the perspectives provided by the 2 approaches on randomized experiments, broken randomized experiments in which treatment nonadherence or attrition occurs, and observational studies in which participants are assigned to treatments on an unknown basis. The authors highlight dimensions on which the 2 approaches have different emphases, including the roles of constructs versus operations, threats to validity versus assumptions, methods of addressing threats to internal validity and violations of assumptions, direction versus magnitude of causal effects, role of measurement, and causal generalization. The authors conclude that investigators can benefit from drawing on the strengths of both approaches in designing research.},

abstract = {In a recent issue of Statistics in Medicine, Ian Shrier [Statist. Med. 2008; 27(14):2740-2741] posed a question regarding the use of propensity scores [Biometrika 1983; 70(1):41-55]. He considered an 'M-structure' illustrated by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Figure 1. In Figure 1, z is a binary exposure, r is a response of interest, x is a measured covariate, and u(1) and u(2) are two unmeasured covariates. Shrier stated that for the M-structure, '... it remains unclear if the propensity method described by Rubin would introduce selection bias or not'. In the same issue, Donald Rubin [Statist. Med. 2002; 27(14):2741-2742] replied by clarifying several key points in the use of propensity scores. He did not, however, discuss the original question posed by Shrier. Given the popularity of both propensity score methods and graphical models, I think any confusion regarding the appropriateness of these methods deserves serious attention and I would therefore like to answer Shrier's question here. The short answer is that for the M-structure, propensity score methods do indeed induce a bias. Below, I will clarify this statement. I will first briefly review the basic idea of propensity scores and then explain why the idea does not apply to the M-structure. I will use a notation which is consistent with Rosenbaum and Rubin [Biometrika 1983; 70(1):41-55].},

abstract = {There is great interest in estimating brain "networks" from FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional "nodes" (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes, based on the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a time (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously and estimate one global network model (e.g., Bayes net models). Many different methods are being used in the literature, but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks, experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in order to compare different connectivity estimation approaches. Our results show that in general correlation-based approaches can be quite successful, methods based on higher-order statistics are less sensitive, and lag-based approaches perform very poorly. More specifically: there are several methods that can give high sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality FMRI data, in particular, partial correlation, regularised inverse covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods; however, accurate estimation of connection directionality is more difficult to achieve, though Patel's $\tau$can be reasonably successful. With respect to the various confounds added to the data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally inaccurate ROIs (when defining the network nodes and extracting their associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to network estimation; hence, results derived from inappropriate ROI definition (such as via structural atlases) should be regarded with great caution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Bayesian probability theory is one of the most successful frameworks to model reasoning under uncertainty. Its defining property is the interpretation of probabilities as degrees of belief in propositions about the state of the world relative to an inquiring subject. This essay examines the notion of subjectivity by drawing parallels between Lacanian theory and Bayesian probability theory, and concludes that the latter must be enriched with causal interventions to model agency. The central contribution of this work is an abstract model of the subject that accommodates causal interventions in a measure-theoretic formalisation that is more general than causal graphs. This formalisation is obtained through a game-theoretic Ansatz based on modelling the inside and outside of the subject as an extended game with imperfect information between two players. Finally, I illustrate the expressiveness of this model with an example of causal induction.},

I show that the conditions usually cited in the literature are overly restrictive and can be relaxed substantially without compromising identification. In particular, I show that natural effects can be identified by methods that go beyond standard adjustment for confounders, applicable to observational studies in which treatment assignment remains confounded with the mediator or with the outcome. These identification conditions can be validated algorithmically from the diagrammatic description of one's model and are guaranteed to produce unbiased results whenever the description is correct. The identification conditions can be further relaxed in parametric models, possibly including interactions, and permit one to compare the relative importance of several pathways, mediated by interdependent variables.

The semiparametric efficiency bound is attained under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we specifically propose the group lasso, which is apt for treatment effects, and derive new results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression.

We show that the former can be done with non-regularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can be efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we substantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an important class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted) maximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we also allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we develop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many variables, and the new method's accuracy and performance is illustrated on simulated and real data.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic association analysis is based on statistical correlations which do not assign any cause-to-effect arrows between the two correlated variables. Normally, such assignment of cause and effect label is not necessary in genetic analysis since genes are always the cause and phenotypes are always the effect. However, among intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers, assigning cause and effect becomes meaningful, and causal inference can be useful.

RESULTS: We show that causal inference is possible by an example in a study of rheumatoid arthritis. With the help of genotypic information, the shared epitope, the causal relationship between two biomarkers related to the disease, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) has been established. We emphasize the fact that third variable must be a genotype to be able to resolve potential ambiguities in causal inference. Two non-trivial conclusions have been reached by the causal inference: (1) anti-CCP is a cause of RF and (2) it is unlikely that a third confounding factor contributes to both anti-CCP and RF.},

abstract = {There are many studies where researchers are interested in estimating average treatment effects and are willing to rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which requires that treatment assignment is as good as random conditional on pre-treatment variables. The unconfoundedness assumption is often more plausible if a large number of pre-treatment variables are included in the analysis, but this can worsen the finite sample properties of existing approaches to estimation. In particular, existing methods do not handle well the case where the model for the propensity score (that is, the model relating pre-treatment variables to treatment assignment) is not sparse. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating average treatment effects in high dimensions that combines balancing weights and regression adjustments. We show that our estimator achieves the semi-parametric efficiency bound for estimating average treatment effects without requiring any modeling assumptions on the propensity score. The result relies on two key assumptions, namely overlap (that is, all units have a propensity score that is bounded away from 0 and 1), and sparsity of the model relating pre-treatment variables to outcomes.},

abstract = {Birthweight is one of the most accessible and most misunderstood variables in epidemiology. A baby's weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree, with developmental problems in childhood and the risk of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal pathway to these health outcomes. Under this assumption of causality, birthweight is used to explain variations in infant mortality and later morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests the link between birthweight and health outcomes may not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume causality are unreliable at best, and biased at worst. The category of 'low birthweight' in particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population (although even this requires special analytical methods).

abstract = {Identifying cause-effect relationships between variables of interest is a central problem in science. Given a set of experiments we describe a procedure that identifies linear models that may contain cycles and latent variables. We provide a detailed description of the model family, full proofs of the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability, a search algorithm that is complete, and a discussion of what can be done when the identifiability conditions are not satisfied. The algorithm is comprehensively tested in simulations, comparing it to competing algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, we adapt the procedure to the problem of cellular network inference, applying it to the biologically realistic data of the DREAMchallenges. The paper provides a full theoretical foun- dation for the causal discovery procedure first presented by Eberhardt et al. (2010) and Hyttinen et al. (2010). Keywords:},

abstract = {In this paper we provide theoretical and empirical evidence of a type of asymmetry between causes and effects that is present when these are related via linear models contaminated with additive non-Gaussian noise. This asymmetry is found in the different degrees of Gaussianity of the residuals of linear fits in the causal and the anti-causal direction. More precisely, under certain conditions the distribution of the residuals is closer to a Gaussian distribution when the fit is made in the incorrect or anti-causal direction. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing the analysis in an extended feature space. In this space the required computations can be efficiently performed using kernel techniques. The effectiveness of a method based on the asymmetry described is illustrated in a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real-world cause-effect pairs. In the experiments performed one observes the Gaussianization of the residuals if the model is fitted in the anti-causal direction. Furthermore, such a method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical studies have shown that conditioning on an instrumental variable (IV), a variable that is associated with exposure but not associated with outcome except through exposure, can increase both bias and variance of exposure effect estimates. Although these findings have obvious implications in cases of known IVs, their meaning remains unclear in the more common scenario where investigators are uncertain whether a measured covariate meets the criteria for an IV or rather a confounder. The authors present results from two simulation studies designed to provide insight into the problem of conditioning on potential IVs in routine epidemiologic practice. The simulations explored the effects of conditioning on IVs, near-IVs (predictors of exposure that are weakly associated with outcome), and confounders on the bias and variance of a binary exposure effect estimate. The results indicate that effect estimates which are conditional on a perfect IV or near-IV may have larger bias and variance than the unconditional estimate. However, in most scenarios considered, the increases in error due to conditioning were small compared with the total estimation error. In these cases, minimizing unmeasured confounding should be the priority when selecting variables for adjustment, even at the risk of conditioning on IVs.},

Most often in network analysis, the edges are given. However, in many systems it is difficult or impossible to measure the network directly. Examples of latent networks include economic interactions linking financial instruments and patterns of reciprocity in gang violence. In these cases, we are limited to noisy observations of events associated with each node. To enable analysis of these implicit networks, we develop a probabilistic model that combines mutually-exciting point processes with random graph models. We show how the Poisson superposition principle enables an elegant auxiliary variable formulation and a fully-Bayesian, parallel inference algorithm. We evaluate this new model empirically on several datasets.},

abstract = {From observational data alone, a causal DAG is only identifiable up to Markov equivalence. Interventional data generally improves identifiability; however, the gain of an intervention strongly depends on the intervention target, that is, the intervened variables. We present active learning (that is, optimal experimental design) strategies calculating optimal interventions for two different learning goals. The first one is a greedy approach using single-vertex interventions that maximizes the number of edges that can be oriented after each intervention. The second one yields in polynomial time a minimum set of targets of arbitrary size that guarantees full identifiability. This second approach proves a conjecture of Eberhardt (2008) indicating the number of unbounded intervention targets which is sufficient and in the worst case necessary for full identifiability. In a simulation study, we compare our two active learning approaches to random interventions and an existing approach, and analyze the influence of estimation errors on the overall performance of active learning.},

It also represents a canonical learning problem and thus has attracted a lot of attention in both the informatics and the statistical learning literature. Numerous approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple clustering to rather involved dynamic Bayesian network modeling, as well as hybrid ones that combine a number of modeling steps, such as employing ordinary differential equations coupled with genome annotation. These approaches are tailored to the type of data being employed. Available data sources include static steady state data and time course data obtained either for wild type phenotypes or from perturbation experiments. This review focuses on the class of autoregressive models using time course data for inferring gene regulatory networks. The central themes of sparsity, stability and causality are discussed as well as the ability to integrate prior knowledge for successful use of these models for the learning task at hand.},

@article{Belloni2011,
abstract = {We propose robust methods for inference on the effect of a treatment variable on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many controls. Our setting is a partially linear model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic disturbances. Our analysis allows the number of controls to be much larger than the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by conditioning on a relatively small number of controls whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of controls. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the "post-double-selection" method. Our results apply to Lasso-type methods used for covariate selection as well as to any other model selection method that is able to find a sparse model with good approximation properties. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application to the effect of abortion on crime rates.},

@article{Strahilevitz2008,
abstract = {This essay argues that there is often an essential conflict between information privacy protections and antidiscrimination principles. Where information privacy law or practical obscurity deprives an employer of pertinent information about a job applicant, the employer often will rely more heavily on distasteful statistical discrimination strategies. For example, the existing empirical evidence suggests that criminal background checks may benefit African American male job applicants as a whole, by permitting employers to sort among ex-cons and those lacking criminal records. In the absence of accurate criminal history information, employers concerned about keeping ex-offenders out of their workplace appear to hire too few African American males - penalizing African American males without criminal records and hiring ex-cons who are members of groups with low offending rates. The essay therefore argues that in the employment context, the government should use information policy as a supplement to traditional antidiscrimination law. More precisely, the government can publish previously private information about individuals so as to discourage decisionmakers' reliance on problematic proxies. An important implication of this insight is that there may be strong antidiscrimination rationales for Megan's Laws, more recent efforts by a handful of jurisdictions to make general criminal history information freely available on the Internet, and government subsidies for programs that make employee's prior work evaluations easily available to prospective employers. The essay further explains why in those settings where the reintegration of ex-cons into the workplace creates societal benefits, information privacy protections for criminal history status will rarely, if ever, be the most appropriate tool for achieving those benefits. The essay concludes by identifying situations in which publishing previously private information about individuals would be a poor strategy for decreasing the prevalence of discrimination.},

abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

@article{Pearl2010a,
abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

abstract = {We give a selective review of some recent developments in causal inference, intended for researchers who are not familiar with graphical models and causality, and with a focus on methods that are applicable to large data sets. We mainly address the problem of estimating causal effects from observational data. For example, one can think of estimating the effect of single or multiple gene knockouts from wild-type gene expression data, that is, from gene expression measurements that were obtained without doing any gene knockout experiments. We assume that the observational data are generated from a causal structure that can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). First, we discuss estimation of causal effects when the underlying causal DAG is known. In large-scale networks, however, the causal DAG is often unknown. Next, we therefore discuss causal structure learning, that is, learning information about the causal structure from observational data. We then combine these two parts and discuss methods to estimate (bounds on) causal effects from observational data when the causal structure is unknown. We also illustrate this method on a yeast gene expression data set. We close by mentioning several extensions of the discussed work.},

@article{Anglemyer2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Researchers and organizations often use evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy of a treatment or intervention under ideal conditions. Studies of observational designs are often used to measure the effectiveness of an intervention in 'real world' scenarios. Numerous study designs and modifications of existing designs, including both randomized and observational, are used for comparative effectiveness research in an attempt to give an unbiased estimate of whether one treatment is more effective or safer than another for a particular population.A systematic analysis of study design features, risk of bias, parameter interpretation, and effect size for all types of randomized and non-experimental observational studies is needed to identify specific differences in design types and potential biases. This review summarizes the results of methodological reviews that compare the outcomes of observational studies with randomized trials addressing the same question, as well as methodological reviews that compare the outcomes of different types of observational studies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of study design (including RCTs versus observational study designs) on the effect measures estimated.To explore methodological variables that might explain any differences identified.To identify gaps in the existing research comparing study designs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases, from January 1990 to December 2013.Along with MeSH terms and relevant keywords, we used the sensitivity-specificity balanced version of a validated strategy to identify reviews in PubMed, augmented with one term ("review" in article titles) so that it better targeted narrative reviews. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: We examined systematic reviews that were designed as methodological reviews to compare quantitative effect size estimates measuring efficacy or effectiveness of interventions tested in trials with those tested in observational studies. Comparisons included RCTs versus observational studies (including retrospective cohorts, prospective cohorts, case-control designs, and cross-sectional designs). Reviews were not eligible if they compared randomized trials with other studies that had used some form of concurrent allocation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In general, outcome measures included relative risks or rate ratios (RR), odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR). Using results from observational studies as the reference group, we examined the published estimates to see whether there was a relative larger or smaller effect in the ratio of odds ratios (ROR).Within each identified review, if an estimate comparing results from observational studies with RCTs was not provided, we pooled the estimates for observational studies and RCTs. Then, we estimated the ratio of ratios (risk ratio or odds ratio) for each identified review using observational studies as the reference category. Across all reviews, we synthesized these ratios to get a pooled ROR comparing results from RCTs with results from observational studies. MAIN RESULTS: Our initial search yielded 4406 unique references. Fifteen reviews met our inclusion criteria; 14 of which were included in the quantitative analysis.The included reviews analyzed data from 1583 meta-analyses that covered 228 different medical conditions. The mean number of included studies per paper was 178 (range 19 to 530).Eleven (73{\%}) reviews had low risk of bias for explicit criteria for study selection, nine (60{\%}) were low risk of bias for investigators' agreement for study selection, five (33{\%}) included a complete sample of studies, seven (47{\%}) assessed the risk of bias of their included studies,Seven (47{\%}) reviews controlled for methodological differences between studies,Eight (53{\%}) reviews controlled for heterogeneity among studies, nine (60{\%}) analyzed similar outcome measures, and four (27{\%}) were judged to be at low risk of reporting bias.Our primary quantitative analysis, including 14 reviews, showed that the pooled ROR comparing effects from RCTs with effects from observational studies was 1.08 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.22). Of 14 reviews included in this analysis, 11 (79{\%}) found no significant difference between observational studies and RCTs. One review suggested observational studies had larger effects of interest, and two reviews suggested observational studies had smaller effects of interest.Similar to the effect across all included reviews, effects from reviews comparing RCTs with cohort studies had a pooled ROR of 1.04 (95{\%} CI 0.89 to 1.21), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 68{\%}). Three reviews compared effects of RCTs and case-control designs (pooled ROR: 1.11 (95{\%} CI 0.91 to 1.35)).No significant difference in point estimates across heterogeneity, pharmacological intervention, or propensity score adjustment subgroups were noted. No reviews had compared RCTs with observational studies that used two of the most common causal inference methods, instrumental variables and marginal structural models. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our results across all reviews (pooled ROR 1.08) are very similar to results reported by similarly conducted reviews. As such, we have reached similar conclusions; on average, there is little evidence for significant effect estimate differences between observational studies and RCTs, regardless of specific observational study design, heterogeneity, or inclusion of studies of pharmacological interventions. Factors other than study design per se need to be considered when exploring reasons for a lack of agreement between results of RCTs and observational studies. Our results underscore that it is important for review authors to consider not only study design, but the level of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of RCTs or observational studies. A better understanding of how these factors influence study effects might yield estimates reflective of true effectiveness.},

abstract = {In machine learning often a tradeoff must be made between accuracy and intelligibility. More accurate models such as boosted trees, random forests, and neural nets usually are not intelligible, but more intelligible models such as logistic regression, naive-Bayes, and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. This tradeoff sometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applications such as healthcare where being able to understand, validate, edit, and trust a learned model is important. We present two case studies where high-performance generalized additive models with pairwise interactions (GA2Ms) are applied to real healthcare problems yielding intelligible models with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia risk prediction case study, the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had prevented complex learned models from being fielded in this domain, but because it is intelligible and modular allows these patterns to be recognized and removed. In the 30-day hospital readmission case study, we show that the same methods scale to large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of patients and thousands of attributes while remaining intelligible and providing accuracy comparable to the best (unintelligible) machine learning methods.},

@article{Frangakis2002,
abstract = {Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable tinder each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate. such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance. and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to forrmulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

abstract = {Much controversy exists regarding proper methods for the selection of variables in confounder control. Many authors condemn any use of significance testing, some encourage such testing, and other propose a mixed approach. This paper presents the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of several confounder selection criteria, including change-in-estimate and collapsibility test criteria. The methods are compared with respect to their impact on inferences regarding the study factor's effect, as measured by test size and power, bias, mean-squared error, and confidence interval coverage rates. In situations in which the best decision (of whether or not to adjust) is not always obvious, the change-in-estimate criterion tends to be superior, though significance testing methods can perform acceptably if their significance levels are set much higher than conventional levels (to values of 0.20 or more).},

abstract = {The very early appearance of abstract knowledge is often taken as evidence for innateness. We explore the relative learning speeds of abstract and specific knowledge within a Bayesian framework and the role for innate structure. We focus on knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general intuitive theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from co-occurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes nets theory of causality and a range of alternatives in a logical language for relational theories. This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories have been learned--an effect we term the blessing of abstraction. We then explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence and find that a collection of simple perceptual input analyzers can help to bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together, these results suggest that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of causality but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion.},

We propose graphical displays that help formalize and visualize the results of sensitivity analyses, building upon the idea of 'tipping-point' analysis for randomized experiments with a binary outcome and a dichotomous treatment. The resulting 'enhanced tipping-point displays' are convenient summaries of conclusions obtained from making different modeling assumptions about missingness mechanisms. The primary goal of the displays is to make formal sensitivity analysesmore comprehensible to practitioners, thereby helping them assess the robustness of the experiment's conclusions to plausible missingness mechanisms. We also present a recent example of these enhanced displays in amedical device clinical trial that helped lead to FDA approval. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Nandy2015,
abstract = {We consider causal structure learning from observational data. The main existing approaches can be classified as constraint-based, score-based and hybrid methods, where the latter combine aspects of both constraint-based and score-based approaches. Hybrid methods often apply a greedy search on a restricted search space, where the restricted space is estimated using a constraint-based method. The restriction on the search space is a fundamental principle of the hybrid methods and makes them computationally efficient. However, this can come at the cost of inconsistency or at least at the cost of a lack of consistency proofs. In this paper, we demonstrate such inconsistency in an explicit example. In spite of the lack of consistency results, many hybrid methods have empirically been shown to outperform consistent score-based methods such as greedy equivalence search (GES). We present a consistent hybrid method, called adaptively restricted GES (ARGES). It is a modification of GES, where the restriction on the search space depends on an estimated conditional independence graph and also changes adaptively depending on the current state of the algorithm. Although the adaptive modification is necessary to achieve consistency in general, our empirical results show that it has a relatively minor effect. This provides an explanation for the empirical success of (inconsistent) hybrid methods.},

@article{Gutman2013,
abstract = {The estimation of causal effects has been the subject of extensive research. In unconfounded studies with a dichotomous outcome, Y, Cangul, Chretien, Gutman and Rubin (2009) demonstrated that logistic regression for a scalar continuous covariate X is generally statistically invalid for testing null treatment effects when the distributions of X in the treated and control populations differ and the logistic model for Y given X is misspecified. In addition, they showed that an approximately valid statistical test can be generally obtained by discretizing X followed by regression adjustment within each interval defined by the discretized X. This paper extends the work of Cangul et al. 2009 in three major directions. First, we consider additional estimation procedures, including a new one that is based on two independent splines and multiple imputation; second, we consider additional distributional factors; and third, we examine the performance of the procedures when the treatment effect is non-null. Of all the methods considered and in most of the experimental conditions that were examined, our proposed new methodology appears to work best in terms of point and interval estimation.},

@article{Petersen2014,
abstract = {The practice of epidemiology requires asking causal questions. Formal frameworks for causal inference developed over the past decades have the potential to improve the rigor of this process. However, the appropriate role for formal causal thinking in applied epidemiology remains a matter of debate. We argue that a formal causal framework can help in designing a statistical analysis that comes as close as possible to answering the motivating causal question, while making clear what assumptions are required to endow the resulting estimates with a causal interpretation. A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.},

@article{Bes2012,
abstract = {The study tests the hypothesis that conditional probability judgments can be influenced by causal links between the target event and the evidence even when the statistical relations among variables are held constant. Three experiments varied the causal structure relating three variables and found that (a) the target event was perceived as more probable when it was linked to evidence by a causal chain than when both variables shared a common cause; (b) predictive chains in which evidence is a cause of the hypothesis gave rise to higher judgments than diagnostic chains in which evidence is an effect of the hypothesis; and (c) direct chains gave rise to higher judgments than indirect chains. A Bayesian learning model was applied to our data but failed to explain them. An explanation-based hypothesis stating that statistical information will affect judgments only to the extent that it changes beliefs about causal structure is consistent with the results.},

@article{Rothman1977,
abstract = {Epidemiologic methods developed to control confounding in non-experimental studies are equally applicable for experiments. In experiments, most confounding is usually controlled by random allocation of subjects to treatment groups, but randomization does not preclude confounding except for extremely large studies, the degree of confounding expected being inversely related to the size of the treatment groups. In experiments, as in non-experimental studies, the extent of confounding for each risk indicator should be assessed, and if sufficiently large, controlled. Confounding is properly assessed by comparing the unconfounded effect estimate to the crude effect estimate; a common error is to assess confounding by statistical tests of significance. Assessment of confounding involves its control as a prerequisite. Control is most readily and cogently achieved by stratification of the data, though with many factors to control simultaneously, multivariate analysis or a combination of multivariate analysis and stratification might be necessary.},
