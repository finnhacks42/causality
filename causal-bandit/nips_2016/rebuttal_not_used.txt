The use of simulated data is common for evaluating causal algorithms as there is a paucity of data for which generating graph and true (individual) causal effects are known. However we will investiate using semi-simulated data, in which the covariate distribition is real but the outcome is simulated.

We focused our experiments in the parallel setting as it allowed us to compare the performance of both our algorithms. We agree it would be worthwile to include some non-parralel settings to illustrate how Alg2 works in more complex graphs and what happens to Alg1 if it is applied for a problem for which it is misspecified. We can compare against additional algorithms such as UCB - the key point is that incorporating causal information allows us to avoid the lower bounds which all existing algorithms are subject to.
