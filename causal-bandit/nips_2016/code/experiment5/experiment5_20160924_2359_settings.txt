Compare the performance of the algorithms on a Confounded Parallel bandit for which 
there is no action to set Z. The Parallel algorithm is mis-specified in this setting, as it assumes there are no confounders.
If the resulting bias exceeds epsilon then the Parallel algorithm will never identify the best arm.
