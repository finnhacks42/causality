\begin{abstract} 
We study the problem of using causal models to improve the rate at which good interventions can be learned online in a stochastic environment. 
Our formalism combines multi-arm bandits and causal inference to model a novel type of bandit feedback that is not exploited by existing approaches.
We propose a new algorithm that can make use of the causal feedback and prove that it achieves bounds on both simple and cumulative regret that are strictly better (in dependence on the number of possible interventions and number of rounds) than algorithms which do not use the additional causal information.
